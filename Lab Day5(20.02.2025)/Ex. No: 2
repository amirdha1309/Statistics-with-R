Task 2: Air Quality Data
data("airquality")

i. Compute mean temperature without built-in function
mean_temp <- sum(airquality$Temp, na.rm = TRUE) / length(na.omit(airquality$Temp))
print(mean_temp)

ii. First five rows
print(head(airquality, 5))

iii. Extract all columns except Temp & Wind
print(airquality[, !(names(airquality) %in% c("Temp", "Wind"))])

iv. Coldest day
coldest_day <- airquality[which.min(airquality$Temp), ]
print(coldest_day)

v. Summary statistics
summary(airquality)

vi. Melt airquality dataset
melted_airquality <- melt(airquality)
print(melted_airquality)

vii. Melt with ID variables as Month and Day
melted_airquality_id <- melt(airquality, id.vars = c("Month", "Day"))
print(melted_airquality_id)

viii. Cast molten dataset with respect to Month and Day
cast_airquality <- dcast(melted_airquality_id, Month + Day ~ variable, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
print(cast_airquality)

ix. Monthly averages
monthly_avg <- dcast(melted_airquality_id, Month ~ variable, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
print(monthly_avg)
